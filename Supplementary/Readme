The details of the clinical data for each datasets can be found in Table S1 separately.

We observed that 174 circRNAs (52 of them were up-regulated and 122 were down-regulated – given in Table S2) in GSE101124 and 
993 circRNA (665 of them were up-regulated and 328 were down-regulated – given in Table S3) in GSE182471 in BC tumor samples were differentially expressed, 
when compared to the control samples.

The overlapped up- and down-regulated circRNAs are given in Table S4 and Table S5 for each dataset seperately.
